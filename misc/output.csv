EPOL593,The Role of Theory in Educational Research,Education Policy  Organization and Leadership,4 hours.,All research is guided by theory. Theory provides a vocabulary  a set of laws or generalizations  a background literature  and a conceptual framework for any effort to plan  design  and execute a research study. There is no theory-free inquiry. This is true in the social sciences as well as the natural sciences. All research seeks to explain phenomena: a theory provides an explanation for those explanations. However  these theoretical assumptions are often implicit and unreflective. Researchers may think they have no theory  or have a theory that is so taken for granted that they don’t recognize it as an assumed theory. Much of educational research suffers from this lack of theoretical self-awareness. Like any other aspect of research  theories are falsifiable. They must stand the test of evidence – which may go against them. The goal of the class is not to identify the "right" or "best" theory  but to make the identification and selection of a theory more critical and reflective. Any major theory has insights  and each has limitations. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

SOC364,Impacts of Globalization,Sociology,3 hours.,In this course  we seek to make sense of the impacts of globalization. Is the freer flow of trade  people  and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic  social  and political ills  or are we inclined to say that  on balance  it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways  are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share  or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course  students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social  cultural  political  and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.
